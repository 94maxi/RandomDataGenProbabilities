# RandomDataGenProbabilities
This file creates a random data generator for a gym with 70k members.
Different probabilities are attributed to different class modalities taken as well as time slots for different age group and genders.
In this way an old female is more likely to pick a modality like yoga at an earlier timeslot.
A young male is more likely to pick weightlifting a prime slot.
